## Carlo's analysis of OECD RTM Data

Work in progress

#### Notes
1. The younger and more manual occupations are more concerned about future skill insufficiencies; this translates into/relates to strong general perceived unemployment risk
2. Those with a higher perceived risk of insufficient skills favor more 'passive' gvnmt protection (social protection, work sharing, robot taxes,...) & (but less strongly) 'active' measures (education, vocational training, infrastructure)
3. Weaker relationships with objective variables (education, age, occupation, exposure to tech at work)
