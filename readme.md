## Carlo's analysis of OECD RTM Data

Work in progress

#### Vulnerability/concern about technical change
1. The younger and more manual occupations are more concerned about future skill insufficiencies; this translates into/relates to strong general perceived unemployment risk
2. Those with a higher perceived risk of insufficient skills favor more 'passive' gvnmt protection (social protection, work sharing, robot taxes,...) & (but less strongly) 'active' measures (education, vocational training, infrastructure)
3. Weaker relationships with objective variables (education, age, occupation, exposure to tech at work)

**Overall story: Young manual workers are vulnerable, and they know it** (_are they represented in any meaningful way?_)

#### Policy preferences & RTI
1. Closer look at Q31 using factor analysis: Answers can be reduced to two factors, one including Qs 31a-c (corresponding to social investment), the second including Qs 31d-g (corresponding to 'passive protection'); Q31h (migration) falls outside
2. Relation factors to occupation/education: Clearly, high-skilled favor active measures, lower-skilled favor passive
3. Younger oppose both active and passive?
4. Positive correlation with RTI and passive measures; negative with active; no relation with offshoreability
5. Cross-country differences: In some countries (ITA, DNK, LTU), relationship between RTI and policy preferences much stronger in others (USA, TUR, POL) - random?
6. Country-level overall approval for passive measures correlates negatively with welfare state; countries with stronger welfare states approve less (DNK, NLD, DEU), countries with weaker ones more (CHL, TUR, PRT); less clear for active (!)
