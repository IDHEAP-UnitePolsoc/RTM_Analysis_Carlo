## Carlo's analysis of OECD RTM Data

Work in progress

#### Notes
1. The younger and more manual occupations are more concerned about future skill insufficiencies; this translates into/relates to strong general perceived unemployment risk
2. Those with a higher perceived risk of insufficient skills favor more 'passive' gvnmt protection (social protection, work sharing, robot taxes,...) & (but less strongly) 'active' measures (education, vocational training, infrastructure)
3. Weaker relationships with objective variables (education, age, occupation, exposure to tech at work)

**Overall story: Young manual workers are vulnerable, and they know it** (_are they represented in any meaningful way?_)


4. Closer look at Q31 using factor analysis: Answers can be reduced to two factors, one including Qs 31a-c (corresponding to social investment), the second including Qs 31d-g (corresponding to 'passive protection'); Q31h (migration) falls outside
